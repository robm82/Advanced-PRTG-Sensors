+ Veeam Backup & Replication - [Blog Post](http://mycloudrevolution.com/2016/03/21/veeam-prtg-sensor-reloaded/)

    For the latest features please use the Script: `PRTG-VeeamBRStats-v3.ps1`
    - V12 support (N-1 compatible)
    - PSx64.exe is not required any more
    - [PRTG HTTP Push Sensor](https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/http_push_data_advanced_sensor) can be used (less load on PRTG Probe / more secure from VBR perspective)

    The `PRTG-VeeamBRStats.ps1` is marked as "legacy" and no further updates will happen to this version.
